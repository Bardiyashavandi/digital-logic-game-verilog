# Electronic Mastermind Game — Verilog

This project implements an electronic version of the Mastermind code-breaking game using Verilog. It was developed as part of the CS 303 Logic and Digital System Design course and implemented on an FPGA.

## Overview
The design supports a two-player game with code-maker and code-breaker roles. Game flow, player turns, scoring, and input validation are controlled using a finite state machine (FSM).

## Features
- FSM-based control logic
- Modular Verilog design
- Button input debouncing
- Seven-segment display (SSD) output
- LED-based feedback for guess correctness
- FPGA deployment and demonstration

## FPGA Demonstration
A working FPGA demo is included in this repository:
- `project.mp4`

## Tools & Technologies
- Verilog
- FPGA-based implementation
- Simulation and hardware verification
- Visual Studio Code
